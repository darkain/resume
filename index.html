				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>Hi, I've <strong>Vince</strong>! Some may know me by my full name <strong>Vincent Milum Jr</strong>, or by one of my online handles: <strong>Darkain</strong>, <strong>DarkainMX</strong>, <strong>Darkain Dragoon</strong>.</p>

				<p>Who am I? A nomadic programmer. A traditional resume does not suite me because my history does not fall into a standard role of <em>"Worked X years for Y company on Z task."</em> Instead, I've created countless software projects and released them on my own as an individual publisher. I've also contributed to several large and small open source projects to help suite my needs in my own projects. This page details a chronological list of several of these projects along with many external references. Over the years I've had to assume the many roles of <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Database Administrator</strong>, <strong>System Administrator</strong>, <strong>Network Administrator</strong>, and <strong>Electronics Hobbyist</strong> to accomplish the tasks required for each of these projects.</p>

				<p>This very page is hosted on GitHub. If you have any questions, inquiries, comments, or otherwise, please feel free to send them to me via this page's GitHub issue tracker! Twitter and Email are also welcomed!</p>

				<h2>Winamp Plugins</h2>

				<p>Created the initial RM-900 infrared remote control plugin for Winamp using Visual Basic to interact with the Creative Labs driver. Support was later expanded to include support for the RM-1000 remote as well.</p>


				<p>Due to the success of the RM-900 plugin, friends asked me to make a plugin for Winamp which would allow their gamepads to change songs, control playback, and change volume. Using DirectInput once again, this plugin was known as DX-Joystick.</p>

				<h2>Winamp Plugins</h2>

				<p>Following the success of RM-900 and DX-Joystick, I merged these two plugins into a single plugin, RM-X General Purpose Control. I added a third module to this plugin known as API-KB which allowed global keyboard shortcuts and multimedia keys to control Winamp while the application is out of focus or minimized.</p>

				<h2>Microsoft Excel</h2>

				<p>Discovered an exploit in Microsoft Excel that allowed for full SQL access through VBA instead of the intended support of only SELECT statements. Used this exploit to write a full SQL INSERT data entry front end and SELECT data reporting system using VBA in Excel 2003. Scripts have since been ported to Excel 2007. To date, I've yet to publish knowledge of this bug and as far as I know it is still fully exploitable. However, Microsoft has significantly locked down running VBA scripts, so risk is extremely minimal.</p>

				<h2>RMX Automation</h2>

				<p>Renamed RM-X General Purpose Control to RMX Automation and released it as open source software under the BSD license.</p>

				<p>The public release of RMX supports <strong>Windows Media Player 7</strong>, <strong>Winamp 2</strong>, <strong>Winamp 3</strong>, <strong>Winamp 5</strong>, <strong>foobar2000</strong>, <strong>Radlight Player</strong>, <strong>BSPlayer</strong>, and as a stand-alone <strong>Win32 Application</strong> all from a single binary binary file by exposing multiple DLL entry points plus a WinMain entry point.</p>

				<p>RMX Automation includes LuaPlus, an object oriented version of the Lua interpreter to make RMX fully scriptable. This release also includes 30 RMX Plugins which include support for integration with many more hardware and software platforms, such as X-10 home automation and several methods of TCP/IP network access. By writing a plugin once for RMX, it instantly works with all softare and systems listed above that RMX can communicate with, without the plugin needing any knowledge of those systems whatsoever.</p>

				<h2>PHP Universal Database Library (PUDL)</h2>

				<p>Open-sourced my PHP library for connecting to and interacting with SQL databases. Created a SQL query generator that transparently works with <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>MariaDB</strong>, <strong>PerconaDB</strong>, <strong>PosgreSQL</strong>, <strong>SQLite</strong>, <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong>, and general <strong>ODBC</strong> servers. Unlike PDO bundled with PHP, the PUDL library works virtually identical with all engines with just a simple connection configuration change.</p>

				<p>PUDL also has direct support for <strong>Galera</strong> multi-master clustering, including load balancing, high-availability, and multi-datacenter awareness.</p>

				<h2>TinyButXtreme</h2>

				<p>Forked the TinyButStrong (TBS) HTML template processor by Skrol29 as TinyButXtreme (TBX). Initial fork was due to dispute over a bug that the initial developer refused to fix. Afterwards, I reorganized all source code and simplified the entire library API. Legacy and insecure features were removed. Fixed several other bugs that persisted in the original code base. New code is now extended with countless new functionality. Code updated for PHP 5.x and modern PHP 7.x support.</p>

				<h2>Cospix</h2>

				<p>Developed and launched the web site <a target="_blank" href="https://cospix.net">Cospix.net</a> as a high quality photo hosting web site for the global cosplay community. Cospix uses the Altaform framework, runs on both PHP and HHVM, uses MariaDB Galera Clustering, Redis caching, and ZFS Raid file storage across multiple systems in a cluster and across multiple data centers.</p>

				<p><strong>Technology Used:</strong></p>
				<cite><ul>
					<li><strong>ZFS File Storage:</strong> User photo storage is handled by a local ZFS Raid-Z pool. Temporary ZFS snapshots are taken every 5 minutes. Snapshots are then sent via SSH ZFS SEND + ZFS RECV to remote servers. Each server runs Lighttpd for serving photos. If a slave is missing a photo (uploaded in the last 5 minutes but not synced yet), Lighttpd automatically reverts to a NFS share back to the central master server to ensure any Lighttpd instance can serve any photo regardless of freshness.</li>

					<li><strong>MariaDB Galera Database:</strong> Relational and graph data is stored in MariaDB with Galera clustering. Every node in the cluster handles read and write operations, to prevent worry about master delegation in case of node maintenance. The cluster is broken up into smaller sub-clusters in each data center. At least one node in each data center is backed by ZFS storage with snapshots taken on regular intervals as a method of keeping historical information and backups in case recovery is required.</li>

					<li><strong>PHP Application:</strong> Main web site programmed in PHP with support for both the PHP and HHVM interpreter.</li>

					<li><strong>Deployment:</strong> New versions of PHP code are deployed using a GitHub Web Hook which initiates a call back to the Cospix web site. This call on the local server then forwards a "sync" call on all PHP nodes to pull latest git code from a GitHub "live" branch. After code is synced on all systems, all static assets (JS, CSS) are rebuilt, compressed, and stored on Lighttpd servers.</li>

				<h2>Cospix Photo Studio</h2>

				<p>Founded the Cospix Photo Studio at Anime Expo (AX). Recruited and lead a team of 20 volunteers to help run the photo booth, including Photographers, Photo Editors, and Social Media Specialist. Anime Expo handles over 100,000 unique attendees over five days and our team captures over 10,000 photos each AX.</p>

				<p>I created a distributed file storage system to synchronize photographs between camera tethered laptops, photo editing workstations, and printing/sales workstations.</p>

				<h2>Microcontrollers and Custom PCB Design</h2>

				<p>Designed and created a prototype portable power supply with an ARM CPU paired with two ATTiny85 microcontrollers for controlling four independent LED arrays. Board is controlled remotely using Bluetooth controllers. I ported the Bluetooth stack from AVR to ARM. Entire system debuted at BlizzCon.</p>

				<p>After initial prototype, I modeled an improved design using Autodesk Eagle, had the PCB printed, and assembled by hand. Changed to design to use Wi-Fi with a custom web server access from cell phones instead of accessed by Bluetooth.</p>

				<h2>Things To Improve</h2>

				<p>There are still references to old source code released that are mentioned on the Archive.org Wayback Machine. I still have these source code archives in the exact state they were published and uploaded in many years ago. These archives, however, are now spread all over the place. It is time to start locating all of these archives and combine them into a single repository hosted on the Darkain.com web site.</p>
