2019: Initial Creation of This Portfolio

Yes, in case you were wondering, I wrote all of this by hand. That includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is all in this one single file, with the only dependency being Google Fonts. Thank you for taking the time to read the source code to see this secret note! You're the best. :)

Also, if you're wondering about the positioning of this note: Some browsers have a compatibility quirk where they need to read the <meta charset> tag within X number of bytes, which is why I always keep that near the very top of all documents. There are other small subtle compatibilities in this document too. Everything here is clean and designed for easy reading/editing, with support for some very old legacy browsers!

And yes, I'm aware of the line length. When writing normal code (such as C/C++, PHP, JavaScript, CSS), I try to keep my lines at or under 80 columns. Because this is English human text though, going through and changing a single word due to a typo can throw all of that off. Once I feel this document is more complete, I may go through and run it through a line-ending tool to wrap these long lines, but until then, please rely on your IDEs!

				<h2>ZeroTier</h2>

				<p>I fixed <em>IPv6-to-Text</em>, and <em>Text-to-IPv6</em> conversions to be RFC-5952 compliant by converting to standard <em>inet</em> functions.</p>

				<p>I use ZeroTier as a <strong>SD-WAN</strong> service to create a virtual multi-premise network. Each node connected to this network is a OPNsense router running OSPF. This enables any device connected to any private LAN at any location to be able to talk directly to any other device in any other location. This is the backbone for my MariaDB Galera cluster and ZFS multi-site replication.

				<h2>Lua on Microcontrollers</h2>

				<p>Ported the Lua programming language to ESP8266 and ESP32. I used this to create LED animation libraries for the SpiderBoard.</p>

				<aside><ul>
					<li>When compiling C/C++ binaries, string literals are copied to RAM for direct addressing and execution. On the ESP8266, there is only 80KiB RAM, which fills up too quickly from these strings. I solved this by moving all strings from RAM to ROM. The stings included in the Lua library are only used for debugging purposes, so having slower access to them has no real effect on normal execution performance.</li>

				<h2>ESP8266 Web Server</h2>

				<p>Entirely rewrote the ESP8266 Web Server class. The initial server class by the ESP8266 community had countless stability issues that I fixed with my rewrite. This enhanced web server was built for the "<strong>Spider 2</strong>" LED board to support an embedded <strong>Lua</strong> script editor and uploader.</p>

				<aside><ul>
					<li>The initial web server used the Arduino string class for parsing HTTP requests, such as header data, URL, and URL parameters. Each item increased RAM usage substantially. I solved this by writing an inline memory tokenizer. This also had the side effect of significantly decreasing the time required to process a request. Both very critical for embedded systems.</li>

					<li>Memory exhaustion is now handled gracefully. Previously, when "new" would fail due to insufficient memory, it would potentially crash the software on the board, forcing a watchdog reset. With the change to "malloc", there are additional checks for failed memory allocations which will now clear all memory allocation for the current HTTP request, and return an error code to the client.</li>

				<h2>Physical address from IP address lookup</h2>

				<p>The Tacoma WA based ISP Click-Network was using customer's router's MAC address for the reverse-DNS name lookup on their public IP address. Most consumer routers use sequential MAC addresses for their WAN, LAN, and Wi-Fi ports. There are publicly available databases of Wi-Fi MAC addresses tied to physical locations as a geolocation lookup service. By combining the reverse-DNS information containing MAC address, checking the two address above/below the WAN MAC, and comparing it to the Wi-fi GEO DNS database, it was possible to pinpoint where someone physically lived to within about 100ft just by knowing their IP address.</p>

				<p>After discovering this information and validating it against known IP addresses and physical locations I was aware of, I reported this information to Click-Network for them to update their reverse-DNS information to no longer be physical location deterministic. This has since been fixed, so I am now sharing it publicly!</p>

				<h2>Microcontrollers and Custom PCB Design</h2>

				<p>Designed and created a prototype portable power supply with an ARM CPU paired with two ATTiny85 microcontrollers for controlling four independent LED arrays. Board is controlled remotely using Bluetooth game controllers. I ported the Bluetooth stack from AVR to ARM. The entire system was debuted at BlizzCon 2017.</p>

				<p>After initial prototype, I modeled an improved circuit design using <strong>Autodesk Eagle CAD</strong>, had the PCB printed, and then I assembled by them by hand. I also changed the design to use Wi-Fi with a custom web server with access via a cell phone instead of accessed by Bluetooth game controllers.</p>

				<h2>Cospix</h2>

				<aside><ul>
					<li><strong>Flex-Box:</strong> Changed legacy square crop thumbnails to thumbnails that retain their aspect ratio. Created dynamic image scaler that changes dynamically based on the current viewport or browser window size.</li>

					<li><strong>Discover:</strong> Created a content recommendation system based on trending viewership and personal historical browsing. This information is partially built from the graph model explained below, as well as pull from other internal content and analytics sources. I also created an infinite scrolling content loading system for the Discover page. Each new page chunk renders HTML server side in about 25-75ms time and is under 3KiB in size, keeping both bandwidth and latency as low as possible.</li>

					<li><strong>Graph Model:</strong> Built a custom graph database and data model representing pop culture media hierarchies. Content is organized into either Universe <em>(eg: Square Enix)</em>, Series <em>(eg: Final Fantasy 4)</em>, Characters <em>(eg: Kain)</em>, and Outfit <em>(eg: Dragoon)</em>. These items are then linked through graph relationships, in that other characters from other series may be Dragoons. These tags are generated by users tagging their photos, and then automatically linking using an AI system by using heuristics from that user input.</li>

					<li><strong>FreeBSD:</strong> Migrated hosting infrastructure from a VMWare vSphere 5.5 host with Debian 7 Virtual Machine to a FreeBSD 10 host with Jails. Switching from Debian VM to FreeBSD Jails cut MariaDB network latency in half.</li>

				<h2>PHP persistent connections to MariaDB</h2>

				<p>While working on Cospix and PUDL <em>(PHP Universal Database Library)</em>, I noticed connection error codes did not match the connection state between PHP and MariaDB Galera Cluster. This turned out to be an edge case with how PHP's MySQLi connector handled persistent connections.</p>

				<h2>Open Source Advocate</h2>

				<p>To help promote various open source projects, I set up a 24/7 torrent seeding machine on a 1gbps WAN connection. I use this machine to host archives of Linux distributions and other open source projects. One example is the entirety of the Debian 7 CD and DVD archives for i386 and AMD64 platforms (70 ISOs in total). I also use host security focused ISOs such as Kali Linux and Tails. Beyond software, I also seed the complete Overclocked ReMix collection from their official torrents archive, featuring over 4000 original video game music remixes.</p>

				<p>Not every organization that produces large software, operating systems, music collections, or other large data sets have the financial means to support the bandwidth to distribute their content. I help these projects out by donating my own bandwidth to their causes. Not all open source contributions are strictly code, and I believe this is a good way to me to help this open source and open content creators to share their works with the world freely.</p>

				<h2>Launched Cospix</h2>

				<p>Developed and launched the web site <a target="_blank" href="https://cospix.net">Cospix.net</a> as a high quality photo hosting web site for the global cosplay community. Cospix uses the Altaform framework, runs on both PHP and HHVM, uses MariaDB Galera Clustering, Redis caching, and ZFS Raid file storage across multiple systems in a cluster and across multiple data centers.</p>

				<p><strong>Technology Used:</strong></p>
				<aside><ul>
					<li><strong>ZFS File Storage:</strong> User photo storage is handled by a local ZFS Raid-Z pool. Temporary ZFS snapshots are taken every 5 minutes. Snapshots are then sent via SSH ZFS SEND + ZFS RECV to remote servers. Each server runs Lighttpd for serving photos. If a slave is missing a photo (uploaded in the last 5 minutes but not synced yet), Lighttpd automatically reverts to a NFS share back to the central master server to ensure any Lighttpd instance can serve any photo regardless of freshness.</li>

					<li><strong>MariaDB Galera Database:</strong> Relational and graph data is stored in MariaDB with Galera clustering. Every node in the cluster handles read and write operations, to prevent worry about master delegation in case of node maintenance. The cluster is broken up into smaller sub-clusters in each data center. At least one node in each data center is backed by ZFS storage with snapshots taken on regular intervals as a method of keeping historical information and backups in case recovery is required.</li>

					<li><strong>PHP Application:</strong> Main web site programmed in PHP with support for both the PHP and HHVM interpreter.</li>

					<li><strong>Deployment:</strong> New versions of PHP code are deployed using a GitHub Web Hook which initiates a call back to the Cospix web site. This call on the local server then forwards a "sync" call on all PHP nodes to pull latest git code from a GitHub "live" branch. After code is synced on all systems, all static assets (JS, CSS) are rebuilt, compressed, and stored on Lighttpd servers.</li>

				<h2>Homebrew / Indie Video Game Developer & Advocate</h2>

				<p>Acted as moderator and community leader for the unofficial <strong>Nintendo DS</strong> community on <strong>LiveJournal</strong> with nearly 2,000 members. I used this and other online platforms to advocate for Homebrew video game developers, which eventually went on to become the modern Indie Video Game development community. During this era, homebrew game developers were not seen as part of the industry, but instead were treated like outcasts that did not belong. The big-three console gaming platforms at the time only wanted large AAA $60+ titles. By developing homebrew games and advocating for other developers using public internet channels, this helped shaped the indie gaming community and industry we have today on platforms such as Steam and the Nintendo Switch.</p>

				<p>Beyond advocacy, I also developed a micro-kernel, user interface, application loader, and several demo applications within the Nintendo DS homebrew community as an operating system under the title <strong>DarkStar</strong> <em>(wordplay on my handle, Darkain)</em>. I built basic clones of Tic-Tac-Toe, Minespeepers, and Lights Out and a Paint Program as demo applications to show how the multi-application loader functioned. Other developers used it as a way to distribute their homebrew games and applications in larger bundles.</p>

				<p>
					I created the DS-Paint demo to illustrate some of the rendering API available within DarkStar. These features included
					full touch screen support,

				<h2>LiveJournal JavaScript Worm</h2>

				<p>By combining some self-contained, self-replicating JavaScript code with a payload to automatically make a post on LiveJournal, I created one of the very first social media worms. This exploit only worked in Internet Explorer by wrapping the JavaScript code in custom XML that IE also supported for executing scripts separately from the main &lt;script&gt; HTML tag. LiveJournal used a tag deny-list rather than an allow-list, so this XML tag was not filtered, allowing the malicious JavaScript code to be ran in the browser. This code was then locked down requiring user interaction to click an HTML button rather than running automatically, and presenting as a Proof-of-Concept to LiveJournal, and they acted swiftly to patch the vulnerability within 24 hours.</p>

				<p>The full exploit XML + JavaScript code was never published otherwise and has since been lost, all that remains is the sniplet of the self-replication part without the exploit payload.</p>

				<h2>Winamp Plugins</h2>

				<p>Created the initial RM-900 infrared remote control plugin for Winamp using Visual Basic to interact with the Creative Labs driver. Support was later expanded to include support for the RM-1000 remote as well.</p>


				<p>Due to the success of the RM-900 plugin, friends asked me to make a plugin for Winamp which would allow their gamepads to change songs, control playback, and change volume. Using DirectInput once again, this plugin was known as DX-Joystick.</p>

				<h2>Things To Improve</h2>

				<p>There are still references to old source code released that are mentioned on the Archive.org Wayback Machine. I still have these source code archives in the exact state they were published and uploaded in many years ago. These archives, however, are now spread all over the place. It is time to start locating all of these archives and combine them into a single repository hosted on the Darkain.com web site.</p>

				<p>At this time, there are still about 20 code repositories that have not been uploaded that have been successfully found. These are all early works in Visual Basic and c/c++. The more recent code has been managed through GitHub since 2012 already.</p>
